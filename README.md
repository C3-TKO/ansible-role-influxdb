# ansible-role-influxdb

This ansible role installs influxdb and the influxdb client packages on a rapsberry pi. InfluxDB will be configured to run on https and add an admin user. As this role is meant to be used within my my-pi-setups repository https://github.com/C3-TKO/my-pi-setups you can not use it as it is.
